# ATtiny416 Pillbox Alarm Application

The application allows the user to set up to four different daily alarm times, such as reminders to take pills at required times. When an alarm occurs, a piezoelectric buzzer generates a pulsating sound and the LED associated with that alarm flashes.

The example is explained in more details in the application note [AN2387](https://www.microchip.com//wwwAppNotes/AppNotes.aspx?appnote=en603897).
